#The World Happiness Report ranks 155 countries based on data from the Gallup World Poll. People completing the survey are asked to rate their current lives, which is averaged across countries to produce a rating on a scale from 0 (worst possible) to 10 (best possible).

#Initialize an elastic net regression model.
#Fit the model to the given input and output features.

# Import packages and functions
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet

# Load the world happiness dataset
happiness = pd.read_csv("world_happiness_2017.csv")

# Define input and output features
X = happiness[['generosity']]
y = happiness[['happiness_score']]

# Scale the input features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Initialize an elastic net regression model
modelENet = ElasticNet()

# Fit the model 
modelENet.fit(X,y)

# Estimated intercept weight
print(modelENet.intercept_)

# Estimated weight for generosity feature
print(modelENet.coef_)

#output below
#[5.35324999]
#[0.]

#Interpretation
#This value is the modelâ€™s intercept. It represents the predicted happiness_score when the generosity feature is 0 (after scaling).
#In this case, the intercept is approximately 5.35, suggesting that the base happiness_score (independent of generosity) is around this value.
