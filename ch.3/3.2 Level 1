#Researchers studying chemical properties of wines collected data on a sample of white wines in northern Portugal. One of the research goals was to cluster wines based on similar chemical properties.
#Fit the k-means clustering model to cluster wines based on volatile acidity (volatile_acidity) and citric acid (citric_acid).

#interpretation 
#the centroids of clusters from a k-means clustering model, which was fitted using two features: volatile acidity and citric acid from a dataset on white wines.
#Rows 1-4, correspond to the different clusters (4 clusters)
#values corresponding to the mean volatile acidity and citric acid for the wines in that cluster.
#By analyzing these clusters, researchers can see patterns and trends in the chemical properties of the wines, potentially associating each cluster with certain flavor profiles or quality levels.
