#Two researchers collected high-resolution images of 13,611 grains of seven varieties of dry beans. Using a computer vision process, 16 features of each bean were extracted.

#Define a set of 8 cross-validation folds. Set the random_state parameter to 66 and shuffle to True.

#Interpretation
#For Linear Discriminant Analysis
#Scores per fold
#These represent the model's classification accuracy for each fold.
#Mean Accuracy: 0.497 (49.7% average accuracy across folds).
#Standard Deviation: 0.141 (14.1% variability in accuracy scores across folds).


#For Gaussian naive Bayes analysis
#Scores per fold
#These represent classification accuracy for each fold using Naive Bayes.
#Mean Accuracy: 0.45 (45% average accuracy across folds).
#Standard Deviation: 0.11 (11% variability in accuracy scores across folds).

#Performance Comparison:

#LDA performed slightly better than Gaussian NB, with higher mean accuracy (49.7% vs. 45%).
#However, LDA had higher variability (14.1% vs. 11%).
#Model Suitability:
#Both models performed modestly, indicating potential issues with feature selection or model fit for this dataset.
