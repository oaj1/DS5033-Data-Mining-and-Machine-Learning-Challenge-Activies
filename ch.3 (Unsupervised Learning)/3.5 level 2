#Researchers studying chemical properties of wines collected data on a sample of white wines in Northern Portugal. A research goal was to cluster wines based on similar chemical properties.
#Use the DBSCAN clustering function to cluster wines. Keep eps and min_samples at default values.
#Fit the DBSCAN model to cluster wines.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

wine = pd.read_csv('wine1.csv')

# Create an input matrix with selected features
X = wine[['citric_acid', 'total_sulfur_dioxide']]

scaler = StandardScaler()
X = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X))

dbModel = DBSCAN()

dbModel.fit(X)

print(dbModel.labels_)

#output
#[-1 -1  0 -1  0  0 -1  0 -1 -1  0  0  0 -1 -1  0 -1  0  0 -1 -1  0  0 -1 0 -1 -1 -1]

#interpretation
#In this output, DBSCAN successfully identified one cluster (labeled as 0) and labeled some points as noise (indicated by -1).
