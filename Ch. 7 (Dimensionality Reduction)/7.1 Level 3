#Two researchers collected high-resolution images of 13,611 grains of seven varieties of dry beans. Using a computer vision process, 16 features of each bean were extracted.

#Construct a forward sequential feature selector with n_features_to_select='auto' and tol=None using the initialized estimator.
#Construct a pipeline that scales the data and performs forward SFS with a linear discriminant analysis model.
#Fit the model at the end of the pipeline using the training set.

#Interpretation
#The forward sequential feature selector (SequentialFeatureSelector) automatically selected the following features: 'Perimeter', 'MajorAxisLength', 'MinorAxisLength', 'ConvexArea', 'EquivDiameter', 'ShapeFactor1', 'ShapeFactor2'
#The classification accuracy on the test set was 0.89 (89%).
#This indicates that the model generalizes well to unseen data when using the selected subset of features.
#An accuracy of 89% is reasonable, suggesting the model effectively separates the seven dry bean classes.
