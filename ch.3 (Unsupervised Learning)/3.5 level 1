#Researchers studying chemical properties of wines collected data on a sample of white wines in Northern Portugal. A research goal was to cluster wines based on similar chemical properties.
#Fit the DBSCAN model to cluster wines.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

wine = pd.read_csv('wine1.csv')

# Create an input matrix with selected features
X = wine[['alcohol', 'fixed_acidity']]

scaler = StandardScaler()
X = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X))

# Cluster using DBSCAN with default options
dbscanModel = DBSCAN()

# Your code goes here
dbscanModel.fit(X)

print(dbscanModel.labels_)

#[-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
# -1 -1 -1 -1 -1]

#interpretation
#This output from running DBSCAN suggests that all of the data points in your wine dataset were labeled as -1,
#which indicates that they were classified as "noise" and did not belong to any cluster.
