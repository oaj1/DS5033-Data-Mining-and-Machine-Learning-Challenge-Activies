Challenge Activities from Machine Learning and Data Mining Course, Fall 2024, through Zybooks


NOTE: CSV files and code CANNOT be downloaded from Zybook Challenge Activities Section. So all outputs are copied and pasted from Zybooks into the respective files as comments. Additionally, I utilized generative AI to interpret results and write down explanations for what my code's output means, since I will not be able to run any of the challenge activities on my computer once the class is finished, due to not being able to download the Zybook challenge activities files.
