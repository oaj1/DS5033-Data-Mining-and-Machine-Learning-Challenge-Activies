#LaGuardia Airport (LGA) is a major airport serving New York City. LGA wanted to predict the arrival delay of an incoming flight based on the departure delay. 50 recent flights were randomly selected, and the arrival delays (in minutes) were recorded.

#Create a dataframe containing distance (distance) and month (month) in that order. Use the reshape() function to ensure the input features are in the proper format.

# Import packages and functions
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Import flights and remove missing values
flights = pd.read_csv('flightsLGA.csv').dropna()

# Define X and y and convert to proper format
X = flights[['distance','month']].values.reshape(-1, 2)
y = flights[['arr_delay']].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Initialize a linear regression model
multipleModel = LinearRegression()

# Fit the linear model
multipleModel = multipleModel.fit(X, y)

print('Intercept:', multipleModel.intercept_)

#output looks like the following
#Intercept: [-8.53201711] 

#Interpretation
#The intercept of -8.53 means that when both distance and month are at zero, the model would predict an arrival delay of -8.53 minutes.
#In practical terms, however, an intercept like this doesn’t hold much real-world significance, as distance and month values of zero aren’t realistic in this context.
