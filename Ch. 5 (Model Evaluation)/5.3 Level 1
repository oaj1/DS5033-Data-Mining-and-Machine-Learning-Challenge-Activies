#This dataset contains body measurements including age, sex, wing, weight, bill length (culmen) and talon length (hallux) for a sample of hawks observed near Iowa City, Iowa. The data was collected by students and faculty at Cornell College over a 10-year period. There are three species represented in this dataset: Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk.
#Use the sklearn.metrics module to calculate a confusion matrix for a Gaussian Naive Bayes model.

# Import packages and functions
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# Load the hawks dataset
hawks = pd.read_csv('hawks.csv')

# Define input and output features
X = hawks[['Hallux', 'Tail']]
y = hawks[['Species']]

# Scale the input features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Initialize and fit a Gaussian naive Bayes model
NBModel = GaussianNB()
NBModel.fit(X, np.ravel(y))

# Calculate the predictions for each instance in X
predHawk = NBModel.predict(X)

# Calculate the confusion matrix 
confMatrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(np.ravel(y), predHawk)

print('GaussianNB model\n', confMatrix)


#output
#GaussianNB model
 #[[ 5  0  0]
 #[ 0 67  0]
 #[ 0  0 28]]

 #Interpretation
#The model seems to perform very well on this dataset. For each species, all instances are correctly classified without any misclassifications.
#There are no off-diagonal entries in the confusion matrix, meaning the model made no incorrect predictions.
#5 instances of Cooper's hawk were correctly predicted as Cooper's hawk.
#67 instances of red-tailed hawk were correctly predicted as red-tailed hawk.
#28 instances of sharp-shinned hawk were correctly predicted as sharp-shinned hawk.
