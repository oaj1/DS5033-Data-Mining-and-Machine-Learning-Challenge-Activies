#This dataset contains body measurements including age, sex, wing, weight, bill length (culmen) and talon length (hallux) for a sample of hawks observed near Iowa City, Iowa. The data was collected by students and faculty at Cornell College over a 10-year period. There are three species represented in this dataset: Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk.
#Use the sklearn.metrics module to calculate accuracy for a Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
#Use the sklearn.metrics module to calculate kappa for a Gaussian Naive Bayes model.


# Import packages and functions
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# Load the hawks dataset
hawks = pd.read_csv('hawks.csv')

# Define input and output features
X = hawks[['Tail', 'Culmen']]
y = hawks[['Species']]

# Scale the input features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Initialize and fit a Gaussian naive Bayes model
NBModel = GaussianNB()
NBModel.fit(X, np.ravel(y))

# Calculate the predictions for each instance in X
predNB = NBModel.predict(X)

# Calculate the accuracy
accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(np.ravel(y),predNB)

# Calculate kappa
kappa = metrics.cohen_kappa_score(np.ravel(y), predNB)

print('GaussianNB model accuracy:', round(accuracy, 3))
print('GaussianNB model kappa:', round(kappa, 3))


#output
#GaussianNB model accuracy: 0.97
#GaussianNB model kappa: 0.944

#interpretation
#Accuracy:
#The model achieved an accuracy of 97% (0.97), meaning that the model correctly classified 97% of the hawks into their respective species 
#(Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, sharp-shinned hawk) based on the Tail and Culmen features.
#Kappa:
#The Cohenâ€™s Kappa score is 0.944, which measures the agreement between the actual and predicted classifications, adjusted for chance agreement.
#A kappa of 0.944 indicates an almost perfect agreement between the model predictions and the true species labels.
