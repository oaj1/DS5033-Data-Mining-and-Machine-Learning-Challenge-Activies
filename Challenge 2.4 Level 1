#LaGuardia Airport (LGA) is a major airport serving New York City. LGA wanted to predict the arrival delay of an incoming flight based on the departure delay. 50 recent flights were randomly selected, and the arrival delays (in minutes) were recorded.

#Initialize a multiple regression model for predicting arrival delay based on departure delay and flight distance.

# Import packages and functions
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Import flights and remove missing values
flights = pd.read_csv('flightsLGA.csv').dropna()

# Define X and y and convert to proper format
X = flights[['dep_delay', 'distance']].values.reshape(-1, 2)
y = flights[['arr_delay']].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Initialize a linear regression model
multipleModel = LinearRegression()

# Fit the linear model
multipleModel = multipleModel.fit(X, y)

print('Intercept:', multipleModel.intercept_)

#output looks as follows
#Intercept: [-8.87963904]
