#Two researchers collected high-resolution images of 13,611 grains of seven varieties of dry beans. 
#Using a computer vision process, 16 features of each bean were extracted.
#Initialize a mean-shift clustering model using scikit-learn with a bandwidth of 2.5.
#Fit the model to the standardized input features in X.
#Print the cluster centers.

#Interpretation
#Centers: [[0.05561953 0.15485362]]: The output shows a single cluster center at coordinates (0.0556, 0.1549)
#This means that, after clustering, Mean Shift identified only one cluster center.
#Cluster labels: [0 0 0 0 ...]: All beans have been assigned the label 0, indicating that they all belong to the same cluster.
